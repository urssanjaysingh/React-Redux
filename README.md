# React Redux GitHub Directory - urssanjaysingh/React-Redux

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the React Redux project - urssanjaysingh/React-Redux!

## Overview

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the React Redux project developed by urssanjaysingh. The project is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and Redux, a predictable state management container for JavaScript apps.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**: Use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/urssanjaysingh/React-Redux.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using npm:

   ```
   cd React-Redux
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Application**: Start the development server using the following command:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   This will launch the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **`src/`**: This directory contains all the source code of the React Redux application.
  - **`components/`**: Contains reusable React components used throughout the application.
  - **`actions/`**: Defines the Redux actions to update the application state.
  - **`reducers/`**: Contains Redux reducers that specify how the application state changes.
  - **`store/`**: Creates the Redux store, combining reducers and applying middleware.
  - **`App.js`**: The main component that renders the application.
  - **`index.js`**: The entry point of the application.
- **`public/`**: Any static assets (HTML, CSS, images, etc.) used by the application.

## Redux Store

The Redux store manages the application state, and it follows the principles of a single source of truth and immutable state. React components can access the state and trigger actions to update it.
